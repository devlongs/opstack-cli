## OP Stack CLI
OP Stack CLI is a Golang command-line utility for easily spinning up an OP Stackâ€“based rollup. This tool wraps the manual steps normally required to deploy an Optimism-based chain, handle address generation, configure environment variables, build repositories, and run the associated services (execution client, consensus client, batcher, proposer, etc.).

#### Warning: The OP Stack is under active development.
